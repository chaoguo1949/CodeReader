This project does not support:
	* loops, if-statements, etc without open/close brackets
	* forward declarations
	* templates
	* nice do-while loop formating
	* closing brackets on the same line as opening brackets

To toggle comments and/or line numbers, the key binding must be run before starting CodeReader.py
