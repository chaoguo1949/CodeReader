This project does not support:
	* loops, if-statements, etc without open/close brackets
	* forward declarations
	* template declarations
	* nice do-while loop formating
	* closing brackets on the same line as opening brackets
	* < and > without one single space on either side if used as operators
	* template containers with more than one template argument

To toggle comments and/or line numbers, the key binding must be run before starting CodeReader.py
